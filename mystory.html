        <p>I have spent over 40,000 hours nurturing babies and caring for young
            children.For the past 10 years I have
            been working exclusively with Infants and helping their families learn the necessary skills and
            tips on how
            to better care for their children’s wellbeing.
            <br>
            <br>

            I am a mother of two beautiful daughters of ages 11 and 13 years old.
            Becoming a mother has radically
            realigned every aspect of my life and introduced me to “my call”. I believe it takes a village
            to raise a
            child and every family deserves emotional, physical and psychological support following the
            birth of their
            newborn.Helping families flourish with their newborn is my passion.
            <br>
            <br>

            To ensure you get the best care, I’ve honed my skills with certifications and trainings from
            prestigious
            national institutes including San Francisco State University.

            In my spare time I enjoy hiking, dancing, cooking, reading, writing, coding, swimming,
            snowboarding,
            skydiving, and golfing.</p>
